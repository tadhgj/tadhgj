My dad got me a Raspberry Pi in middle school, and the rest is history.

### Some things I've made:

- **[RURadar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ruradar/id6472299023)**, a bus tracking app for Rutgers Students. iOS app built in Swift & SwiftUI. _1000+ **daily** active users._

- **[Queuebit](https://queuebit.vercel.app)**, an advanced song queue viewer for Spotify. Node.js backend hosted on Vercel. Avaliable to all Spotify users.

- **[SXCTrack](https://sxctrack.com/)**, a database for cross country/track athletes. PHP backend hosted on CentOS VPS running cron jobs. Bootstrap 4 frontend.
